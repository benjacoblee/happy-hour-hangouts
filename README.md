## User stories
    As a [bar-goer], I'd like [the ability to see happy hour offers] so that I can [make informed choices]
    As a [bar-goer], I'd want to [contribute information] in order to [benefit other bar-goers]
    As a [bar-goer], I'd like to [save happy hour hangouts] to [revisit them later]

## Approach
    Started with idea generation
    ERD
    Wireframing
    List out CRUD routes
    Implementation of hashed login
    Create, read, update, delete bar entries
    Added ability to comment
    Allow users to bookmark favorite bars
    Added ability to find bars nearby

## Motivations
    Develop familiarity with the usage of APIs
    To learn more about AJAX and its use cases
    To be more proficient with hashing and cookie usage
    Become more comfortable with writing database queries

## Unsolved problems
    Make app purpose easier to understand
    Sometimes mapping over comments in bar.jsx produces an error. Tried handling it using a conditional but doesn't seem to work. 
    Manually set timezone to Singapore using Moment Timezone library. Need to find a better way to display dates based on user location
    In the future, should find a better way to handle user experience (e.g. no indicator for upload progress, no immediate feedback after clicking on nearby bars)

## Credits
    Kev and Nat for helping me with implementation of Google API
    Akira for pointing out that API can only be used from server-side ;)
