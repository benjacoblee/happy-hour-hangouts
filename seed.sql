Think again. 

Skip the over-crowded and pricey watering holes in town for a scenic escape complete with a picturesque view of the sea. At Panamericana, Asahi beer, bubbly, selected cocktails and hour-pour wine and spirits start from a cool $5 at 5pm. Prices increase by a dollar with every passing hour – but that means that drinks are still an affordable $9 even at 9pm. 

Come bask in Sentosa’s evening glow and toast to the end of the week. ', 'https://media.timeout.com/images/105553488/1372/772/image.jpg', 2, NOW());
