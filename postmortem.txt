Approach and Process

What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?

- Start small.

- Was dead set in using API. Entire project idea changed (due to not knowing how to use Zomato API). Could've prepared better by reading API documentation.

- Commited more. 

- Not change file names/database name/project name halfway through project (GITHUB DOESN'T KNOW)

What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?

- Approach the problem methodically. console.log() everything. Have an idea of what my code is gonna do, run it, confirm/deny assumption.

Code and Code Design
What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?
- Simultaneously using custom stylesheet and bootstrap classes.
- A lot of conditional rendering. Hard to keep track. 

What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?
- Asking for help for ideas and implementation of technologies/libraries :)

For each, please include code examples.

axios
      .get(endpoint)
      .then(barsResponse => {
        data.bars = barsResponse.data.results;
        response.render("barsnearby", data);
      })
      .catch(err => {
        console.log(err);
      });

What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
- Obsessing over problems

What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
- Obsessing over problems

How is the overall level of the course during this unit? 
- Really excited to have a functioning frontend/backend app that does something meaningful in a real-life context. 
- Gitbook is still unclear and not very helpful.

Notes to self
- Use Axios
- Identify what should be split up (i.e. models, controller)
